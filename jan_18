started fixing fullstack 

 changed all css to flexbox

start notes for sec. testing. 

create markdown files for relevant notetaking. 

edit resume and cover letter templates.

You should probably fix the modals, add the code first. 

But, before you fix the modals, try and find a grain of sanity within your insanity.
